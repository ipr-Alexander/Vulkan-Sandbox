# Vulkan-Sandbox
My vulkan sandbox for learning new stuff and maintain knowledge.

## Requirements
- CMake
- Vulkan 1.1 or later
- C++ compiler

## Repo goal
The long term goal of this repo is to create a fully functioning rendering engine to create a small game.
It will also be used, depending on status, to render a top-view GPR with realtime migration using compute shaders.

## Status
Currently the engine/sandbox is too barebone to be used.
